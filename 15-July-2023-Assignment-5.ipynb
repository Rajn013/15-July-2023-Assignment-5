The reduced representation of faces can be used as input for further tasks, such as face recognition, expression analysis, or clustering similar faces."

    "\n",
    "Filter methods: These methods assess the relevance of each feature based on certain criteria, such as statistical tests (e.g., correlation, ANOVA), and independently of the chosen machine learning algorithm. Features are ranked or scored based on their individual properties, and a threshold is set to select the most important ones.\n",

They involve repeatedly fitting the model with different subsets of features and evaluating its performance on a validation set. The search for the best feature subset can be computationally expensive but may result in better-performing models.\n",
